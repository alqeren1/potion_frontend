# Potion Leaderboard

A responsive, interactive single-page application built with React and Next.js that displays a dynamic leaderboard for Solana memecoin traders. The app consumes a mock API to display trader data and includes functionality for filtering, sorting, and searching. Wallet connection is required to unlock the full experience.

## Overview

**Project Purpose:**  
This project was developed as a submission for the Potion Leaderboard frontend challenge. It replicates the Figma designs with added responsiveness and improved UX. Key features include:
- **Data Integration:** Fetches trader data from a mock API (using seedrandom for consistent demo data).
- **Filtering & Sorting:** Users can filter by various trading metrics (PNL, win rate, avg buy, etc.) and sort columns in both ascending and descending orders.
- **Search:** Dynamic search bar to filter by wallet address or Twitter handle.
- **Wallet Connection:** Users must connect their wallet to access full functionalities such as viewing trader profiles and using search/filters.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile views.

## Features

- **Wallet Connection:**  
  Only connected users can interact with search, filter, and view detailed profiles.

- **Search Functionality:**  
  Allows users to search by contract name or Twitter handle.

- **Dynamic Filtering:**  
  Multiple filtering options are available through a slide-out drawer or modal. Filter criteria are persisted using localStorage.

- **Sortable Columns:**  
  All columns are clickable to sort data based on the selected timeframe (daily, weekly, monthly, or all-time).

- **Pagination:**  
  Provides pagination controls to navigate through trader listings.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alqeren1/potion_frontend.git
   cd potion_frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   if you get errors installing, try: 
   ```bash
   npm install --force
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   if you want to try the page from your phone in local wifi network:

  ```bash
  npm run dev:wifi
  ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

## Testing & Usage

- **Mock API:**  
  The API endpoint at `/api/main` serves randomized trader data for demonstration purposes.
  The random info is generated with a seed so the initial data doesn't change if the seed is the same. 
  If you want to change the data, you can simply change the seed to a random word.

- **Wallet Integration:**  
  The app checks if the userâ€™s wallet is connected. If not, it prompts for connection. Use Phantom wallet (or any supported wallet) to fully test the application.

- **Search & Filters:**  
  Enter a wallet address or Twitter handle in the search bar, or search for a token name or address on the profile page. Use the filters panel to refine results based on metrics like realized PNL, win rate, and more.

- **Sorting & Pagination:**  
  Click on any column header to toggle sorting order. Use pagination buttons to navigate through pages.

## Design Decisions & Assumptions

- **Framework & Libraries:**  
  Chose React with Next.js for SSR capabilities and improved SEO. Tailwind CSS was used for rapid and responsive styling.

- **Data Generation:**  
  Used the `seedrandom` library to generate consistent random data for demo purposes.

- **Wallet Requirement:**  
  Full interaction (profile views, filter usage, sorting) is restricted to connected users only, as asked.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Special attention was given to ensure the UI adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Deployment

For staging or production, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Build the project:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   or
   #########################
   yarn build
   ```

2. **Start the production server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
  ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

3. **Deployment Platforms:**  
   You can deploy the application to Vercel, Netlify, or any platform that supports Next.js. The project is configured to work out of the box on Vercel with minimal configuration.
